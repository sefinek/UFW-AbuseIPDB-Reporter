# 🛡️ UFW AbuseIPDB Reporter
A utility designed to analyze UFW logs and report IP addresses blocked by the firewall to the [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com) database.  
To prevent excessive reporting of the same IP address within a short period, the tool uses a temporary cache file to track previously reported IP addresses.

This project was originally written in [Bash](https://github.com/sefinek/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter/tree/bash) but has been rewritten in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). All my integration tools are now written in Node, hence this change.
If you were using the old version, please [uninstall it](https://github.com/sefinek/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-uninstall-the-deprecated-version-if-you-have-it) as it will no longer be supported.

If you like this repository or find it useful, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could give it a star ⭐. Many thanks!

## 📋 Requirements
1. [Node.js + npm](https://nodejs.org)
2. [PM2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) (`npm i pm2 -g`)
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com)
4. Ubuntu Server or Debian


## ✅ Features
1. **Easy Configuration** – The [`config.js`](config.default.js) file allows for quick and simple customization.
2. **Simple Installer** – Enables fast and seamless integration deployment.
3. **Self-IP Protection** – The script will never report an IP address belonging to you or your server, even if you use a dynamic IP.
4. **Discord Webhooks Integration**:
   - Important notifications.
   - Alerts for script errors.
   - Daily summaries of reported IP addresses.
5. **Automatic Updates** – The script regularly fetches and applies the latest updates. If you want, you can disable it, of course.


## 📥 Installation (Ubuntu & Debian)

### Automatic (easy & fast & recommenced)
#### Via curl
```bash
bash <(curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sefinek/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter/main/install.sh)
```

#### Via wget
```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sefinek/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter/main/install.sh)
```

### Manually
#### Node.js installation
```bash
sudo apt install -y curl
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo -E bash nodesource_setup.sh && sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

#### Git installation

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y install git 
```

#### Commands
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/sefinek/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter.git
cd UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter
npm install
cp config.default.js config.js
sudo chmod 644 /var/log/ufw.log
node .
^C
npm install pm2 -g
sudo mkdir /var/log/ufw-abuseipdb
sudo chown $USER:$USER /var/log/ufw-abuseipdb -R
pm2 start
pm2 startup
[Paste the command generated by pm2 startup]
pm2 save
```


## 🗑️ Uninstall the [deprecated](https://github.com/sefinek/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-ufw-abuseipdb-reporter) version if you have it
```bash
sudo systemctl stop abuseipdb-ufw.service && sudo systemctl disable abuseipdb-ufw.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/abuseipdb-ufw.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo rm -r /usr/local/bin/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter
```


## 🖥️ Usage
After a successful installation, the script will run continuously in the background, monitoring UFW logs and automatically reporting IP addresses.

Servers are constantly scanned by bots, usually looking for security vulnerabilities and similar weaknesses.
So don't be surprised if the number of reports sent to AbuseIPDB exceeds a thousand the next day.

### 🔍 Checking logs
```bash
pm2 logs ufw-abuseipdb
```
