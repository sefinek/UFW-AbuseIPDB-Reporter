# 🛡️ UFW AbuseIPDB Reporter
A utility designed to analyze UFW logs and report IP addresses blocked by the firewall to the [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com) database.  
To prevent excessive reporting of the same IP address within a short period, the tool uses a temporary cache file to track previously reported IP addresses.

This project was previously written in Bash but has been rewritten in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). All my integration tools are now written in Node, hence this change.
If you were using the old version, please [uninstall it](https://github.com/sefinek/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter/tree/node.js?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-remove-the-old-version) as it will no longer be supported.

If you like this repository or find it useful, I’d greatly appreciate it if you could give it a star ⭐. Many thanks!

## 📥 Installation

### Automatic (Easy & recommenced)
#### curl
```bash
cd /tmp && curl -s -o /tmp/install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sefinek/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter/node.js/install.sh && sudo bash install.sh && rm install.sh
```

#### wget
```bash
cd /tmp && wget -q -O /tmp/install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sefinek/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter/node.js/install.sh && sudo bash install.sh && rm install.sh
```

### Manually
#### Node.js installation (Ubuntu & Debian)
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y curl
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo -E bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

#### Git installation
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install git 
```

#### Script
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/sefinek/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter.git
cd UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter
npm install
cp default.config.js config.js
sudo chmod 644 /var/log/ufw.log
node .
^C
npm uninstall corepack -g
npm install pm2 -g
sudo mkdir /var/log/ufw-abuseipdb
sudo chown $USER:$USER /var/log/ufw-abuseipdb -R
pm2 start
pm2 startup
[Paste the command generated by pm2 startup]
pm2 save
```


## 🗑️ Uninstall the deprecated version if you have it
```bash
sudo systemctl stop abuseipdb-ufw.service && sudo systemctl disable abuseipdb-ufw.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/abuseipdb-ufw.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo rm -r /usr/local/bin/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter
```


## 🖥️ Usage
After successful installation, the script will run continuously in the background, monitoring UFW logs and automatically reporting malicious IP addresses.
The tool requires no additional user action after installation. However, it's worth occasionally checking its operation and updating the script regularly (by running the installation command).

Servers open to the world are constantly scanned by bots, usually looking for vulnerabilities or other security gaps.
So don't be surprised if the next day, the number of reports to AbuseIPDB exceeds a thousand.

### 🔍 Checking logs
```bash
pm2 logs ufw-abuseipdb
```
