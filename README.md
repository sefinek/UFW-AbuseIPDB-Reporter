# 🛡️ UFW AbuseIPDB Reporter
A utility designed to analyze UFW firewall logs and report malicious IP addresses to the [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com) database.  
To prevent redundant reporting of the same IP address within a short period, the tool uses a temporary cache file to track previously reported IPs.

If you like this repository or find it useful, I would greatly appreciate it if you could give it a star ⭐. Thanks a lot!

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/sefinek/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter.git
cd UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter
npm install
cp default.config.js config.js
sudo chmod 644 /var/log/ufw.log

## 🗑️ Remove the old version
```bash
sudo systemctl stop abuseipdb-ufw.service
sudo systemctl disable abuseipdb-ufw.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/abuseipdb-ufw.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo rm -r /usr/local/bin/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter
```


## 🖥️ Usage
After successful installation, the script will run continuously in the background, monitoring UFW logs and automatically reporting malicious IP addresses.
The tool requires no additional user action after installation. However, it's worth occasionally checking its operation and updating the script regularly (by running the installation command).

Servers open to the world are constantly scanned by bots, usually looking for vulnerabilities or other security gaps.
So don't be surprised if the next day, the number of reports to AbuseIPDB exceeds a thousand.

### 🔍 Checking logs

pm2 logs ufw-abuseipdb
```
